## 5.5. **PRIORITY: Intelligent Scheduling System** ðŸ§ 
**Modular n8n workflows for dynamic task scheduling and real-time plan adaptation**

### Phase 1: Core Scheduling Decision Engines
- [ ] **Step 1: Build Scheduler Decision Engine Workflow (`scheduler_decision_engine.json`)**
    - [ ] Create input schema: task object + current schedule context + schedule template
    - [ ] Implement decision matrix logic:
        - [ ] Priority scoring algorithm (deadline urgency Ã— priority Ã— dl_hardness)
        - [ ] Available time block analysis from schedule template
        - [ ] Dependency checking (don't schedule if dependencies aren't complete)
        - [ ] Current schedule density evaluation (avoid overloading days)
    - [ ] Output: boolean decision + reasoning + suggested time window
    - [ ] Add comprehensive logging for decision rationale

- [ ] **Step 2: Build Time Block Allocator Workflow (`time_block_allocator.json`)**
    - [ ] Create intelligent time slot selection logic:
        - [ ] Find earliest suitable time block that fits task duration
        - [ ] Respect user energy patterns from schedule template (focused work blocks, break times)
        - [ ] Maintain 5-minute buffers between tasks (configurable)
        - [ ] Consider task type vs. optimal time slots (creative work in morning, admin in afternoon)
    - [ ] Implement conflict detection and resolution
    - [ ] Add dependency validation (ensure prerequisite tasks are scheduled first)
    - [ ] Output: specific datetime slot + potential conflicts + rationale

- [ ] **Step 3: Build Reschedule Engine Workflow (`reschedule_engine.json`)**
    - [ ] Create cascade rescheduling logic for when changes occur:
        - [ ] Identify all tasks affected by a schedule change
        - [ ] Re-evaluate available time blocks for each affected task
        - [ ] Maintain priority ordering while minimizing total disruption
        - [ ] Handle tasks that no longer fit (defer to next day with notification)
    - [ ] Implement priority preservation (high priority tasks keep better time slots)
    - [ ] Add boundary enforcement (respect work hours, lunch breaks, personal time)
    - [ ] Create summary of all changes made with user-friendly explanations

### Phase 2: Orchestration Workflows
- [ ] **Step 4: Build Morning Planner Workflow (`morning_planner.json`)**
    - [ ] Create daily planning orchestration:

        - [ ] Get current schedule template and existing schedule for today
        - [ ] Call Scheduler Decision Engine for each unscheduled task
        - [ ] For tasks that should be scheduled, call Time Block Allocator
        - [ ] Use Reschedule Engine to resolve any conflicts
        - [ ] Generate comprehensive daily schedule with explanations
    - [ ] Add user presentation logic (format schedule for UI display)
    - [ ] Implement approval workflow (user can accept/modify before finalizing)
    - [ ] Create fallback handling for overloaded days (suggest task deferrals)

- [ ] **Step 5: Build Dynamic Adjuster Workflow (`dynamic_adjuster.json`)**
    - [ ] Handle real-time schedule changes:
        - [ ] **Task Early Completion:** Free up time, check if other tasks can be pulled forward
        - [ ] **Task Runs Late:** Assess impact on subsequent tasks, call Reschedule Engine
        - [ ] **New Urgent Task:** Use Decision Engine + Allocator, then Reschedule existing tasks
        - [ ] **Task Cancellation:** Free up time block, opportunity to advance other tasks
    - [ ] Implement change impact assessment (show user what's affected)
    - [ ] Add user notification system (explain changes and get approval if needed)
    - [ ] Create undo functionality for unwanted automatic changes

### Phase 3: Integration & Intelligence
- [ ] **Step 6: Enhance Scheduler with AI Decision Making**
    - [ ] Integrate vector search for similar task scheduling patterns
    - [ ] Add learning from user's scheduling preferences over time
    - [ ] Implement smart defaults based on task type, project, and historical data
    - [ ] Create personality-driven scheduling (aggressive packing vs. generous buffers)

- [ ] **Step 7: Connect Scheduling System to Task Management**
    - [ ] Update task_creator.json to automatically trigger scheduling for new tasks
    - [ ] Update task_updater.json to trigger Dynamic Adjuster for status changes
    - [ ] Connect to mobile UI for real-time schedule updates
    - [ ] Add webhook triggers for external calendar changes (future enhancement)

- [ ] **Step 8: Build Scheduling Preferences Management**
    - [ ] Create UI for managing schedule template (work hours, break times, energy patterns)
    - [ ] Add scheduling rules management (no meetings Friday afternoons, morning focus blocks)
    - [ ] Implement scheduling style preferences (tight packing vs. loose scheduling)
    - [ ] Create override system for special scheduling requests

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polish
- [ ] **Step 9: Smart Conflict Resolution**
    - [ ] Build intelligent meeting vs. task prioritization
    - [ ] Add travel time calculation for location-based tasks
    - [ ] Implement recurring task scheduling logic
    - [ ] Create deadline negotiation suggestions (task won't fit, suggest deadline extension)

- [ ] **Step 10: Scheduling Analytics & Optimization**
    - [ ] Track scheduling accuracy (planned vs. actual completion times)
    - [ ] Identify patterns in task duration estimates vs. reality
    - [ ] Build recommendations for better time estimation
    - [ ] Create scheduling efficiency reports for user feedback
