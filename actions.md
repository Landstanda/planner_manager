**Action:** Drafted comprehensive project plan and added detailed tasks to `task.md` based on README.
  **Outcome:** `task.md` now contains actionable items categorized across infrastructure, backend, frontend, testing, and documentation.

**Action:** Updated task list to reflect existing n8n deployment in Fly.io
  **Outcome:** Marked n8n deployment tasks as complete and added new tasks for documentation, version control, and API integration.

**Action:** Updated task list to focus on cloud-based development instead of local development
  **Outcome:** Added tasks for cloud deployment configuration, remote development setup, and cloud-based backup procedures.

## 2024-06-09
- Updated `README.md` to add a new section documenting the n8n workflow architecture, including the modular structure (`main_planner.json`, `life_folder.json`, `todo.json`, `calendar.json`) and the plan to switch from Slack to front-end integration.
- Updated `task.md` to reflect the modular n8n workflow structure, added tasks for replacing Slack with HTTP/Webhook trigger for front-end integration, and marked relevant tasks as complete.

## 2024-06-11
**Action:** Created `fly.toml` for the Next.js app in `nextjs_app` directory and confirmed `Dockerfile` suitability for Fly.io deployment.
  **Outcome:** `nextjs_app/fly.toml` created with app name "chief-of-staff" and region "sjc". The task for containerization and Fly.io configuration in `task.md` was marked as complete.

**Action:** Documented existing n8n configuration and volume setup in `n8n_deployment_setup.md`.
  **Outcome:** Created `n8n_deployment_setup.md` containing the `fly.toml`, `Dockerfile`, volume details, and environment variable considerations for the n8n Fly.io deployment. Marked the corresponding task in `task.md` as complete.

**Action:** Configured secrets management strategy for Next.js app and n8n communication.
  **Outcome:** Updated `nextjs_app/.env.example` with `N8N_BASE_URL` and `N8N_WEBHOOK_API_KEY`. Clarified that Next.js secrets (like n8n webhook API key) will be set in Fly.io dashboard. Updated `task.md` to reflect that n8n webhooks will be secured, deferring specific key setup to workflow development.

**Action:** Created `DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` to document the hybrid local and remote (Fly.io) development workflow.
  **Outcome:** `DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` provides guidance on using `.env.local` for local Next.js development against deployed n8n, and `flyctl deploy` for testing. Task marked complete in `task.md`.

**Action:** Created GitHub Actions CI workflow for Next.js app.
  **Outcome:** Basic CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) configured for build and lint on pushes/PRs to `main` branch. Task marked complete in `task.md`.

**Action:** Resolved Next.js Docker build error and performed initial manual deployment of 'chief-of-staff' app.
  **Outcome:** Created `nextjs_app/next.config.js` with `output: 'standalone'` to fix Docker build. Manually launched and deployed 'chief-of-staff' to Fly.io. App is live. Next step: manually create the persistent volume `chief_of_staff_data` as it was not prompted during deploy.

## 2025-01-XX (Recent Progress)
**Action:** Designed and implemented comprehensive personality assessment system for AI personalization.
  **Outcome:** Created `personality_assessment.json` with 5 core personality dimensions (criteria, motivation_direction, warm_candid, proactive_reactive, reassurance_needs, language_variety), complete scoring system, and LLM analysis prompts for free-form responses. Updated `README.md` and `supabase_tables.sql` with personality assessment documentation and database schema.

**Action:** Created comprehensive Supabase database schema for the Daily Planner AI system.
  **Outcome:** Developed `supabase_tables.sql` with complete table definitions for projects, tasks, daily_schedule, schedule_template, user_llm_instructions, and user_personality_profile. Includes proper indexes, triggers, and constraints. Successfully executed in Supabase SQL editor.

**Action:** Configured Supabase integration for both n8n workflows and Next.js application.
  **Outcome:** Added Supabase credentials (URL, anon key, service role key) to n8n and Fly.io secrets for `chief-of-staff` app. Updated `nextjs_app/.env.example` with Supabase environment variables. Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` client library and created test API route (`/api/test-supabase`) for connection verification.

**Action:** Established environment variable management strategy for local development and production deployment.
  **Outcome:** Updated `.env.example` with complete Supabase and n8n configuration. Documented process for setting Fly.io secrets for production deployment. Created test infrastructure to verify database connectivity before proceeding with feature development.

## 2025-05-23
**Action:** Successfully tested and deployed Supabase integration for both local development and production environments.
  **Outcome:** Created `.env.local` with actual Supabase credentials for local development. Fixed ESLint error in test API route. Removed unnecessary volume mount configuration from `fly.toml`. Successfully deployed updated Next.js app to Fly.io. Both local (`http://localhost:3000/api/test-supabase`) and production (`https://chief-of-staff.fly.dev/api/test-supabase`) endpoints return successful connection responses, confirming full Supabase integration is working correctly with all database tables accessible.

## 2025-12-31
**Action:** Applied database migration to separate dependencies and subtasks in the tasks table.
  **Outcome:** Successfully added new `subtasks` column to tasks table, migrated existing data from `dependencies` to `subtasks`, cleared the `dependencies` column for its intended purpose (blocking dependencies), and added clear column comments. The migration `add_subtasks_column_and_migrate_dependencies` was applied successfully to the Supabase database. Tasks table now has proper semantic separation: `dependencies` for tasks that must be completed before this task can start, and `subtasks` for child tasks that are part of this parent task.

**Action:** Cleared old project data from docs table and migrated task embeddings for n8n vector search.
  **Outcome:** Successfully removed old "Deep Work" book content from docs table and repurposed it for the task management system. Applied migration `setup_docs_table_for_tasks` that populates docs table with task content (title + description), structured metadata (task_id, title, project_id, status, priority, etc.), and existing embeddings. The `match_docs` function is now working correctly for semantic task search in n8n workflows. Both Supabase Vector Store nodes in task_creator.json can now properly search and return relevant task information instead of empty pageContent.

## 2025-01-27 (Current Session)
**Action:** Attempted to test Supabase MCP access after user added personal access token and restarted Cursor
  **Outcome:** Still receiving "Unauthorized. Please provide a valid access token to the MCP server via the --access-token flag or SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN." errors when attempting to list projects or organizations. This indicates the personal access token needs to be provided to the MCP server itself, either via environment variable (SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN) or MCP server configuration. The token may not be properly accessible to the MCP server despite being added to Cursor.

## 2025-01-21 - MCP Supabase Connection Fixed ✅

**Issue:** MCP Supabase server was failing with "Unauthorized" errors due to missing/incorrect access token configuration.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Two `mcp.json` files existed causing duplication (global + project-specific)
- Environment variable `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` was not set in shell
- User had generated new token but only updated mcp.json files, not shell environment

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Located duplicate MCP configuration files:
   - `/home/jeff/.cursor/mcp.json` (global)
   - `/home/jeff/planner_manager/.cursor/mcp.json` (project-specific)
2. Set environment variable: `export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="sbp_25ecea19edf75471b3cf3bb3b09fa444d346c443"`
3. Tested connection successfully - can access "FoReal" project (tiihtjxjedhgmzexixqs)

**Database Access Verified:**
- ✅ List projects/tables working
- ✅ SQL execution working  
- ✅ Populated empty `schedule_template` table with 12 workday time blocks
- ✅ No more RLS permission errors

**Current Status:** 
MCP Supabase fully operational. Ready to test scheduler_decision_engine.json and time_block_allocator.json workflows with real database access.

**Next:** Test the scheduling system workflows with actual database integration.

## 2024-01-15 - MCP Supabase Connection Issue Resolution

**Problem**: MCP Supabase connection failing with "Unauthorized" errors despite having valid token
**Investigation Steps**:
1. Found two mcp.json files: global (/home/jeff/.cursor/mcp.json) and project-specific (/home/jeff/planner_manager/.cursor/mcp.json)
2. Both contained same token "sbp_25ecea19edf75471b3cf3bb3b09fa444d346c443" but different command structures
3. Root cause: SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable not set in shell (confirmed empty with echo command)

**Solution**: Set environment variable with export command: `export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="sbp_25ecea19edf75471b3cf3bb3b09fa444d346c443"`

**Outcome**: 
- MCP connection successful
- Accessed "FoReal" project (tiihtjxjedhgmzexixqs)
- Listed all tables successfully
- Populated empty schedule_template with 12 workday time blocks via SQL insert

## 2024-01-15 - Reschedule Engine Workflow Completed

**Task**: Create third core scheduling workflow - reschedule_engine.json
**Previous Issue**: JSON formatting error with extra closing brace caused file deletion

**Solution**: Recreated reschedule_engine.json with proper JSON formatting
**Features Implemented**:
- Input processing for 4 change event types (task completed early, runs late, new urgent task, cancelled)
- Impact analysis to identify affected schedule entries
- AI agent with detailed prompts for intelligent rescheduling decisions
- Priority preservation and disruption minimization logic
- Boundary enforcement using schedule template
- Success/failure handling with database updates
- Comprehensive output format with reasoning and user notifications

**Technical Details**:
- Uses daily_schedule and schedule_template tables for data
- Sophisticated JavaScript code for analyzing time windows and conflicts
- AI agent uses GPT-4.1 with temperature 0.3 for consistent decision making

## 2025-01-27 - n8n MCP Analysis & README Discrepancy Review

**Action:** Connected to n8n instance via MCP and analyzed all "CoF_" (Chief of Flow) workflows to identify discrepancies with README documentation.

**Analysis Results:**
Found 6 Chief of Flow workflows in production n8n instance:
1. **CoF_Timeblock-Allocator** - Finds optimal time slots for approved tasks (NEW - not in README)
2. **CoF_Task-Updater** - Enhanced task update system with vector search and Supabase integration (ENHANCED)
3. **CoF_Rescheduler** - Handles cascade rescheduling when changes occur (NEW - not in README)  
4. **CoF_Task-Creator** - Creates tasks with AI-powered subtask breakdown and embeddings (ENHANCED)
5. **CoF_SchedulingDecider** - Simplified decision engine for whether/when to schedule tasks (NEW - not in README)

**Key Discrepancies Found:**
- **Database Migration**: All workflows now use **Supabase** instead of Google Sheets mentioned in README
- **Enhanced AI Integration**: Workflows include vector search, embeddings, and sophisticated LLM agents
- **New Architecture**: 5 specialized workflows instead of the 4 mentioned in README (main_planner, life_folder, task_creator, task_updater, chief, scheduler)
- **Advanced Features**: Personality-driven responses, dependency checking, subtask automation not documented in README

**Outcome:** Identified need to update README documentation to reflect the more sophisticated, Supabase-based scheduling architecture that has been implemented. The actual workflows are significantly more advanced than what's currently documented.

## 2025-01-27 - Comprehensive CoF_SchedulingDecider Refactor: Work Block Enforcement & Priority-Based Task Bumping

**Problem:** Fundamental architectural issues identified by user:
1. **Mixed Data Model**: `daily_schedule` contained both routine items (Morning Routine, Lunch) AND work tasks
2. **No Work Block Respect**: AI scheduled during any free time, not just designated work blocks
3. **No Priority Logic**: AI couldn't bump lower priority tasks for higher priority ones
4. **Missing Integration**: No connection to rescheduler workflow for bumped tasks

**Solution: Complete System Refactor**

### Step 1: Database Structure Cleanup ✅
- **Cleaned `daily_schedule`**: Removed routine items (Morning Routine, Deep Work Block, Task Execution Time), kept only actual scheduled tasks/appointments
- **Enhanced table structure**: Added task-specific fields:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE daily_schedule ADD COLUMN:
  - task_id UUID REFERENCES tasks(id)
  - priority INTEGER  
  - task_type VARCHAR(50) (task/appointment/meeting)
  - scheduled_by VARCHAR(100) (manual/ai_scheduler/rescheduler)
  ```
- **Updated existing data**: Added appropriate metadata to remaining appointments (Client Call, Workshop, Doctor Appointment)

### Step 2: Work Block Architecture Verification ✅
- **Confirmed**: `schedule_template` already properly designed with:
  - `block_type: "available"` for work time blocks (4 blocks: 07:30-09:45, 10:00-12:00, 13:00-14:45, 15:00-16:45)
  - `block_type: "personal"` for routine/blocked time (morning routine, lunch, breaks, family, sleep)

### Step 3: Enhanced AI Agent with Priority Logic ✅
**New Intelligent Features:**
- **Work Block Enforcement**: Only schedules during `block_type: "available"` blocks
- **Available Slot Calculation**: Finds gaps within work blocks that fit task duration
- **Priority-Based Bumping**: Can bump lower priority tasks (higher numbers) for higher priority ones
- **Comprehensive Decision Logic**: Three-way output instead of binary schedule/reject

**Enhanced AI Capabilities:**
```javascript
// NEW: Calculate available time slots within work blocks
calculateAvailableSlots(workBlocks, scheduledTasks, taskDuration, targetDate)

// NEW: Find tasks that could be bumped (lower priority + reschedulable)  
findBumpableTasks(scheduledTasks, newTaskPriority)
```

### Step 4: Three-Way Decision Architecture ✅
**New Structured JSON Output:**
- **`"action": "schedule"`**: Direct scheduling in available slot
- **`"action": "bump"`**: Bump lower priority task, includes `bump_task_uid`
- **`"action": "reject"`**: Cannot schedule, with detailed reasoning

**Enhanced Workflow Paths:**
- **Schedule Path**: Direct calendar allocation
- **Bump Path**: Automatically calls `CoF_Rescheduler` workflow 
- **Reject Path**: Returns to caller with reasoning

### Step 5: Complete Integration ✅
- **Updated "Enhanced Switch"**: Three branches instead of two
- **Added "Call CoF_Rescheduler"**: Automatic integration for bumped tasks
- **Enhanced Context Data**: Available slots, bumpable tasks, work blocks metadata
- **Improved Error Handling**: Validates JSON output, fallback for legacy formats

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- **Workflow Version**: scheduler_decision_engine_v3.0_priority_aware
- **AI Model**: GPT-4.1 with temperature 0.2 for consistent decisions
- **Database Integration**: Enhanced Supabase queries with task-specific fields
- **Error Recovery**: Multiple parsing strategies for different input formats

**Expected Behavior Changes:**
- ✅ **Respects Work Boundaries**: Never schedules during personal time blocks
- ✅ **Priority Intelligence**: Can bump Task Priority 4 for Task Priority 2
- ✅ **Smart Slot Finding**: Calculates exact available gaps within work blocks
- ✅ **Workflow Integration**: Seamless handoff to rescheduler when bumping needed
- ✅ **Detailed Reasoning**: AI explains why it made each decision

**System Architecture Now:**
1. **`schedule_template`**: Defines routine structure (personal blocks) + available work blocks
2. **`daily_schedule`**: Contains ONLY scheduled tasks/appointments with priorities
3. **`CoF_SchedulingDecider`**: Intelligent work-block-aware scheduling with priority bumping
4. **`CoF_Rescheduler`**: Handles cascade rescheduling when tasks are bumped

**Next**: Test the complete enhanced system with real priority scenarios.

## Architecture Migration: n8n to Python FastAPI Services

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Action**: Updated project architecture documentation to reflect migration from n8n workflows to Python FastAPI services  
**Outcome**:
