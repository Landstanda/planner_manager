**Action:** Drafted comprehensive project plan and added detailed tasks to `task.md` based on README.
  **Outcome:** `task.md` now contains actionable items categorized across infrastructure, backend, frontend, testing, and documentation.

**Action:** Updated task list to reflect existing n8n deployment in Fly.io
  **Outcome:** Marked n8n deployment tasks as complete and added new tasks for documentation, version control, and API integration.

**Action:** Updated task list to focus on cloud-based development instead of local development
  **Outcome:** Added tasks for cloud deployment configuration, remote development setup, and cloud-based backup procedures.

## 2024-06-09
- Updated `README.md` to add a new section documenting the n8n workflow architecture, including the modular structure (`main_planner.json`, `life_folder.json`, `todo.json`, `calendar.json`) and the plan to switch from Slack to front-end integration.
- Updated `task.md` to reflect the modular n8n workflow structure, added tasks for replacing Slack with HTTP/Webhook trigger for front-end integration, and marked relevant tasks as complete.

## 2024-06-11
**Action:** Created `fly.toml` for the Next.js app in `nextjs_app` directory and confirmed `Dockerfile` suitability for Fly.io deployment.
  **Outcome:** `nextjs_app/fly.toml` created with app name "chief-of-staff" and region "sjc". The task for containerization and Fly.io configuration in `task.md` was marked as complete.

**Action:** Documented existing n8n configuration and volume setup in `n8n_deployment_setup.md`.
  **Outcome:** Created `n8n_deployment_setup.md` containing the `fly.toml`, `Dockerfile`, volume details, and environment variable considerations for the n8n Fly.io deployment. Marked the corresponding task in `task.md` as complete.

**Action:** Configured secrets management strategy for Next.js app and n8n communication.
  **Outcome:** Updated `nextjs_app/.env.example` with `N8N_BASE_URL` and `N8N_WEBHOOK_API_KEY`. Clarified that Next.js secrets (like n8n webhook API key) will be set in Fly.io dashboard. Updated `task.md` to reflect that n8n webhooks will be secured, deferring specific key setup to workflow development.

**Action:** Created `DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` to document the hybrid local and remote (Fly.io) development workflow.
  **Outcome:** `DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` provides guidance on using `.env.local` for local Next.js development against deployed n8n, and `flyctl deploy` for testing. Task marked complete in `task.md`.

**Action:** Created GitHub Actions CI workflow for Next.js app.
  **Outcome:** Basic CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) configured for build and lint on pushes/PRs to `main` branch. Task marked complete in `task.md`.
